# Project Blueprint

## Project Overview
This is a framework-less web project consisting of `index.html`, `style.css`, and `main.js`. The AI is tasked with adding dark mode and light mode functionality, a "저녁 메뉴 추천" (dinner menu recommendation) feature with images, ensuring all user-facing text is in Korean, and integrating a Formspree contact form for partnership inquiries.

## Current Features
- Basic HTML structure (`index.html`)
- Basic styling (`style.css`)
- Basic JavaScript logic (`main.js`)
- Dark Mode/Light Mode Toggle: Users can switch between dark and light themes, and their preference is saved locally.
- 저녁 메뉴 추천 (Dinner Menu Recommendation): A section recommending dinner menus with a button to get new recommendations, fully localized in Korean, now including images.
- **제휴 문의 (Partnership Inquiry) Form**: A simple contact form integrated with Formspree for partnership inquiries.
- **블로그 섹션 (Blog Section)**: A dedicated section in `index.html` with placeholder articles to host original and valuable content, enhancing the site's appeal for AdSense.
- **개인정보처리방침 (Privacy Policy)**: A `privacy.html` page containing a generic privacy policy, linked from the footer of `index.html`, to ensure legal compliance and build user trust.

## Plan for Current Request: Add Privacy Policy and Update Blueprint

### Objective
Add a privacy policy page (`privacy.html`), link it from `index.html`, add necessary styling, and update this `blueprint.md` to reflect all recent changes (blog section and privacy policy).

### Steps
1.  **Create `privacy.html`**: Create a new HTML file for the privacy policy with generic content. (Completed)
2.  **Modify `index.html`**: Add a link to `privacy.html` in the footer. (Completed)
3.  **Modify `style.css`**: Add basic styling for the new privacy policy link. (Completed)
4.  **Update `blueprint.md`**: Document the new features and plan. (Completed)
5.  **Commit and Push**: Stage all changes, commit them with a descriptive message, and then `git push` to deploy. (Pending)
